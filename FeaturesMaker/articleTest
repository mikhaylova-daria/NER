History
The origins of A.T. Kearney goes back to the founding of McKinsey in 1926 in Chicago by James McKinsey under the name James O. McKinsey & Company.

James McKinsey hired Andrew Thomas Kearney in 1929 as the firm's first partner, before roping in Marvin Bower. In 1935, Marshall Field's became a client, and convinced James McKinsey to leave the firm to accept a temporary position and become its CEO to help the company through a restructuring. After McKinsey left, the remaining members of the firm agreed to merge with accounting firm Scovell, Wellington & Company, creating the firm McKinsey, Wellington & Company. In 1937, James McKinsey died unexpectedly of pneumonia. While the firm continued to operate as before, Andrew Thomas Kearney and the remaining partners disagreed over how to run the company, leading to the division of McKinsey, Wellington & Company in 1939. C. Oliver Wellington returned to manage Scovell, Wellington & Company and took the accounting practice with him. The management practice was split into two affiliated firms: Andrew Thomas Kearney continued to run the original Chicago office, renaming the firm McKinsey, Kearney & Company, while Marvin Bower, the head of the New York office, continued the practice in New York and retained the rights to the name McKinsey & Company in all areas other than the Midwest. In 1947, Bower purchased the exclusive rights to the name McKinsey & Company from Tom Kearney, who renamed his firm A.T. Kearney & Company.
