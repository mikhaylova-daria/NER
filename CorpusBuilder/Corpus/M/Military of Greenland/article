The government of Greenland does not have control of Greenland's military or foreign affairs. The defence of Greenland is the responsibility of Denmark. However, following the November 2008 referendum on increased autonomy, which attracted significant popular support (72% turnout, 75% vote in favor), the governments of Greenland and Denmark have agreed to a 30-point package that will begin to reverse this position.

Native military
Greenland has no regular military, although it has an armed coast guard that patrols the Greenlandic coast and carries out search and rescue operations.
