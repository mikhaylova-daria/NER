Ludwig van Beethoven's Opus 1 is a set of three piano trios (written for piano, violin, and violoncello), first performed in 1793 in the house of Prince Lichnowsky, to whom they are dedicated. The trios were published in 1795.

Despite the Op. 1 designation these were not Beethoven's first published compositions; this 
distinction belongs to his Dressler Variations for keyboard (WoO 63).

Op. 1 No. 1 - Piano Trio No. 1 in E-flat major
* Allegro (E flat major)
* Adagio cantabile (A flat major)
* Scherzo. Allegro assai (E flat major, with a trio in A flat major)
* Finale. Presto (E flat major)

Op. 1 No. 2 - Piano Trio No. 2 in G major
* Adagio - Allegro vivace (G major)
* Largo con espressione (E major)
* Scherzo. Allegro (G major, with a trio in B minor)
* Finale. Presto (G major)

Op. 1 No. 3 - Piano Trio No. 3 in C minor
* Allegro con brio (C minor)
* Andante cantabile con Variazioni (E flat major)
* Minuetto. Quasi allegro (C minor, with a trio in C major)
* Finale. Prestissimo (C minor)

This 3rd piano trio was later reworked by Beethoven into the C minor string quintet, Op. 104.
