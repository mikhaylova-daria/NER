Vabis was a Swedish car and truck manufacturer, founded in 1891 as Vagnfabriks Aktiebolaget i Södertälje in municipality of Södertälje to produce railway cars.

The first Vabis automobile (though the name was not applied until after this) was a four-seater designed by Gustaf Erikson in Surahammar in 1897. Strongly resembling a contemporary carriage, it used a one-cylinder kerosene engine, tiller steering, and was not a success. Erikson replaced it with a tube-ignition four-stroke flat-twin in 1898, mounting it in a horse carriage, which he drove briefly. He then joined Vagnfabrik AB at Södertälje, building cars. The first truck appeared in 1902.

Vabis merged with Maskinfabriks AB Scania in 1911, to create AB Scania-Vabis.

Many examples of Vabis, Scania and Scania-Vabis commercial and military vehicles can be seen at the Marcus Wallenberg-hallen (the Scania Museum) in Södertälje.
