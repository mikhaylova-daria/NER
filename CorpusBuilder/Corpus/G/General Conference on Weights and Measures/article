The General Conference on Weights and Measures is the senior of the three Inter-governmental organizations established in 1875 under the terms of the Metre Convention to represent the interests of member states. The treaty, which also set up two further bodies, the International Committee for Weights and Measures and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures , was drawn up to coordinate international metrology and to coordinate the development of the metric system.

The conference meets in Sèvres (south-west of Paris) every four to six years. Initially it was only concerned with the kilogram and the metre, but in 1921 the scope of the treaty was extended to accommodate all physical measurements and hence all aspects of the metric system. In 1960 the 11th CGPM approved the Système International d'Unités, usually known as "SI".

Establishment
On 20 May 1875 an international treaty known as the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention) was signed by 17 states. This treaty established the following organisations to conduct international activities relating to a uniform system for measurements:
*Conférence générale des poids et mesures (CGPM), an intergovernmental conference of official delegates of member nations and the supreme authority for all actions;
*Comité international des poids et mesures (CIPM), consisting of selected scientists and metrologists, which prepares and executes the decisions of the CGPM and is responsible for the supervision of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures;
*Bureau international des poids et mesures (BIPM), a permanent laboratory and world centre of scientific metrology, the activities of which include the establishment of the basic standards and scales of the principal physical quantities and maintenance of the international prototype standards.

The CGPM acts on behalf of the governments of its members. In so doing, it appoints members to the CIPM, receives reports from the CIPM which it passes on to the governments and national laboratories on member states, examines and where appropriate approves proposals from the CIPM in respect of changes to the International System of Units (SI), approves the budget for the BIPM (over €10 million in 2012) and it decides all major issues concerning the organization and development of the BIPM.

Membership criteria
The CGPM recognises two classes of membership - full membership for those states that wish to participate in the activities of the BIPM and associate membership for those countries or economies that only wish to participate in the MRA program. Associate members have observer status at the CGPM. Since all formal liaison between the convention organisations and national governments is handled by the member state's ambassador to France, it is implicit that member states must have diplomatic relations with France, though during both world wars, nations that were at war with France retained their membership of the CGPM. The opening session of each CGPM is chaired by the French foreign minister and subsequent sessions by the Président de l'Académie des Sciences de Paris.

Of the twenty countries that attended the Conference of the Metre in 1875, representatives of seventeen signed the convention on 20 May 1875. In April 1884 HJ Chaney, Warden of Standards in London unofficially contacted the BIPM inquiring whether the BIPM would calibrate some metre standards that had been manufactured in the United Kingdom. Broch, director of the BIPM replied that he was not authorised to perform any such calibrations for non-member states. On 17 September 1884, the British Government signed the convention on behalf of the United Kingdom. This number grew to 21 in 1900, 32 in 1950, and 49 in 2001. , there are 55 Member States and 38 Associate States and Economies of the General Conference (with year of partnership in parentheses):

Notes


Associates

At its 21st meeting (October 1999), the CGPM created the category of "associate" for those states not yet members of the BIPM and for economic unions.

CGPM meetingswww.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM1 1st (1889)The International Prototype Kilogram (IPK), a cylinder made of platinum-iridium and the International Prototype Metre, an X-cross-section bar also made from platinum-iridium were selected from batches manufactured by the British firm Johnson Matthey. Working copies of both artifacts were also selected by lot and other copies distributed to member nations, again by lot. The prototypes and working copies were deposited at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (Bureau international des poids et mesures), Sèvres, France.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM2 2nd (1897)No resolutions were passed by the 2nd CGPM.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM3 3rd (1901)The litre was redefined as volume of 1 kg of water.

The degree Celsius was selected from three names in use as the name of the unit of temperature. The symbol l (lowercase L) was adopted as symbol for litre. Both the comma and dot on a line are accepted as decimal marker symbols. Symbols for the stere and second changed www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ViewCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM9&RES7. The universal return to the Long Scale numbering system was proposed but not adopted.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM10 10th (1954)The kelvin, standard atmosphere defined. Work on the International System of Units (metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, candela) began.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM11 11th (1960)The metre was redefined in terms of wavelengths of light. The Units hertz, lumen, lux, tesla were adopted. The new MKSA-based metric system given the official symbol SI for Système International d'Unités and launched as the "modernized metric system". The prefixes pico-, nano-, micro-, mega-, giga- and tera- were confirmed.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM12 12th (1964)The original definition of litre 1 dm3 restored. The prefixes atto- and femto- were adopted.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM13 13th (1967)The second was redefined as duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom at a temperature of 0 K. The Degree Kelvin renamed kelvin and the candela redefined.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM14 14th (1971)A new SI base unit, the mole defined. The names pascal and siemens as units of pressure and electrical conductivity were approved.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM15 15th (1975)The prefixes peta- and exa- were adopted. The units gray and becquerel were adopted as radiological units within SI.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM16 16th (1979)The candela and sievert were defined. Both l and L provisionally allowed as symbols for litre.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM17 17th (1983)The metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM18 18th (1987)Conventional values were adopted for Josephson constant, KJ, and von Klitzing constant, RK, preparing the way for alternative definitions of the ampere and kilogram.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM19 19th (1991)New prefixes yocto-, zepto-, zetta- and yotta- were adopted.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM20 20th (1995)The SI supplementary units (radian and steradian) become derived units.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM21 21st (1999)A new SI derived unit, the katal mole per second, was adopted as the SI unit of catalytic activity.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM22 22nd (2003)A comma or a dot on a line are reaffirmed as decimal marker symbols, and not as grouping symbols in order to facilitate reading; "numbers may be divided in groups of three in order to facilitate reading; neither dots nor commas are ever inserted in the spaces between groups".www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM23 23rd (2007)The definition of the kelvin was clarified and thoughts about possible revision of certain base units discussed.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM24 24th (2011)Proposal to revise the definitions of the SI units, including redefining the kilogram in relation to the Planck constant were accepted in principle, subject to certain technical criteria having been met.www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM=25 25th (2015)Redefining the kilogram in relation to the Planck constant was discussed but not decided on. Progress towards realising the redefinition has been noted. However, it was concluded that the data did not yet appear to be sufficiently robust. Continued effort on improving the data has been encouraged, such that a resolution that would replace the current definition with the revised definition can be adopted at the 26th meeting.
