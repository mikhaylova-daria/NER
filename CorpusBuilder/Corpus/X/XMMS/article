X Multimedia System (XMMS) is an audio player for Unix-like systems released under a free software license.

History
XMMS was originally written as X11Amp by Peter and Mikael Alm in November 1997. The player was made to resemble Winamp, which was first released in May that year. As such, XMMS has supported Winamp 2 "classic" skins since its release. Though the original release was made under a license that did not provide any access to the program's source code, it is now released under the GNU General Public License.

On June 10, 1999, 4Front Technologies decided to sponsor X11Amp development and the project was renamed to XMMS - the name being an acronym for X MultiMedia System. Most XMMS users take this to mean "X11 MultiMedia System" or "X Window System MultiMedia System"; the official interpretation of the "X" is "Cross-platform".

Forks
XMMS has continued to use GTK+ 1.x toolkit, despite a major revision of GTK (2.x) being available for several years. The primary reason for this reluctance to upgrade is that many XMMS plugins (written by third parties) are dependent on the older version of GTK+ to properly function, e.g., "about" boxes and configuration dialogs. Many software developers also consider the XMMS codebase to be poorly designed and difficult to maintain. These factors led to various forks and related projects:

* The Beep Media Player, a fork of XMMS code that uses GTK+ 2, started around 2003
** youki.mp/ Youki, the remade continuation of Beep Media Player, started around the end of 2005
** Audacious, a fork from Beep Media Player started around 2005 when Beep Media Player development ceased in favor of Youki
* GTK+2 based fork by Mohammed Sameer, named XMMS2.
