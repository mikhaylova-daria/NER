Rovi was known as Macrovision Solutions Corporation (Macrovision) until it changed its name in July 2009.

History
Rovi was established under the name Macrovision Corporation in 1983. The 1984 film The Cotton Club was the first video to be encoded with Macrovision technology when it was released in 1985. The technology was subsequently extended to DVD players and other consumer electronic recording and playback devices such as digital cable and satellite set-top boxes, digital video recorders, and portable media players. By the end of the 1980s, most major Hollywood studios were utilizing their services.

With a number of acquisitions in the 1990s, Macrovision’s products and services managed access control and secure distribution of other forms of digital media, including music, video games, Web text and graphics, and computer software.

John O. Ryan (Founder and CEO of Macrovision from June 1995 to October 2001) and William A. Krepick (president of Macrovision Corporation from July 1995 – July 2005 and CEO from October 2001 to July 2005) led the company through an IPO in 1997 priced at $9.00 a share. Under their leadership, the company was transformed from a private company with sales of under $20M to a global, publicly traded corporation with annual sales of $220M and market cap exceeding $1B.

In July 2005, the company made a change in the management team, and brought on-board Alfred J. Amoroso as chief executive officer and president to succeed William A. Krepick, who announced his request to retire in early the same year.

Under Mr. Amoroso’s leadership the company changed its direction and vision, and announced that it was going to acquire Gemstar-TV Guide May 2, 2008 in a cash-and-stock deal worth about $2.8 billion. The combine company would seek to be “the homepage for the TV experience,” said Mr. Amoroso.

After the announcement of the intent to acquire Gemstar-TV Guide, Macrovision Corporation completed additional transactions, selling its software business unit to a private equity firm, Thomas Cressey Bravo valued at approximately $200 million, to move its business out of the software licensing market and into the entertainment technology market. The divestiture of the software business unit closed on April 1, 2008 and the standalone company was named Acresso Software.

The acquisition of Gemstar-TV Guide closed the following year on May 2, 2008. During the transaction period, Macrovision divested other areas of its non digital entertainment business, including TryMedia, eMeta, TV Guide Magazine, TV Guide Network and the TV Games Network.

The company also made additional acquisitions: All Media Guide on November 6, 2007 and substantially all the assets of Muze, Inc. on April 15, 2009. Both companies provide entertainment metadata.

On July 16, 2009, Macrovision Solution Corporation announced the official change of its name to Rovi Corporation.

Rovi announced the availability of its first product as the new company, on January 7, 2010. The product was TotalGuide™. TotalGuide was launched as an interactive media guide that incorporated entertainment data, to power search, browse and provide recommendation capabilities.

On March 16, 2010, MediaUnbound was acquired by Rovi Corporation for an undisclosed amount, the company helped build static and dynamic personalization and recommendation engines for a number of clients, including Napster, eMusic and MTV Networks.

Rovi began to create advertising offerings announcing the Rovi Advertising Network on June 16, 2010, which bundled guide advertising and third-party interactive TV platforms to extend audience reach even further, into 15.8 million U.S. households.

To help streamline metadata tagging globally, Rovi helped create an international coalition, along with MovieLabs, CableLabs and Comcast that launched the first, non-profit, Entertainment Identifier Registry to catalog movies, television shows and other commercial audio/video assets with unique identifiers. The company hoped to create a standard for metadata tagging that could be used by content creators and providers around the world, with support from Deluxe, Universal Pictures, Neustar, Paramount Pictures, Sonic Solutions, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Walt Disney Pictures, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Motion Picture Association of America, Inc., Civolution, Vobile, INA (L’institut national de l’audiovisuel), among others.

On December 23, 2010, the company announced its intention to acquire Sonic Solutions, and its DivX video software in a deal valued at $720 million. Sonic provided digital video processing, playback and distribution technologies and owned RoxioNow (formerly CinemaNow) an OTT technology provider. Sonic acquired DivX in 2010, which at the time had a presence on more than 350 million consumer electronic devices.

With this acquisition, Rovi broadened its range of products and services for content owners, device makers, retailers, and operators with a white-label digital video online storefront and video streaming and delivery technologies.

On March 1, 2011, SideReel was acquired by Rovi Corporation for an undisclosed amount. San Francisco-based SideReel was one of the most successful online video guides, surpassing one million daily visits.

The company announced that Mr. Amoroso’s intentions to retire on May 26, 2011. Tom Carson, formerly the executive vice president of sales and marketing at Rovi, was appointed CEO and President in December 2011.

As the company shifted its focus on “growth opportunities related to its core enabling technology and services” the company announced that it intended pursue the sale of Rovi Entertainment Store business. It entered into separate agreements to sell Rovi Entertainment Store to Reliance Majestic Holdings, a private equity backed company; and its consumer websites to All Media Networks, a new company in July 2013.

Continuing on this path, the company made a similar announcement indicating its intent to pursue the sale of DivX and MainConcept businesses, in January 2014.

On April 1, 2013, IntegralReach, a predictive analytics platform that integrates massive data from set-tops, smart TVs, tablets, stream servers, was acquired by Rovi Corporation. The cloud-based platform was designed from the ground up to deliver timely intelligence and actionable insights that are only possible with data from millions of homes and scaled computing resources.

After the acquisition, this technology became a part of Rovi’s entertainment analytics and ultimately, their Audience Management Solutions.

Facebook began using Rovi Video in April 2013. The social media site wanted a database of in-depth information on movies, TV shows and celebrities to offer people more ways to express the things they love on their profiles.

Legacy products and technologies
Rovi (as Macrovision) historically developed technologies and products that helped protect content from being pirated. Its two core legacy products were called RipGuard and ACP (analog copy protection).

RipGuard
Macrovision introduced its RipGuard technology in February 2005. It was designed to prevent or reduce digital DVD copying by altering the format of the DVD content to disrupt the ripping software. Although the technology could be circumvented by several current DVD rippers such as AnyDVD or DVDFab, Macrovision claimed that 95% of casual users lack the knowledge and/or determination to be able to copy a DVD with RipGuard technology.

Analog video formats convey video signals as a series of “lines”. Most of these lines are used for constructing the visible image, and are shown on the screen. But several more lines exist which do not convey visual information. Known as the vertical blanking interval (VBI), these extra lines historically served no purpose other than to contain the vertical synchronizing pulses, but in more modern implementations they are used to carry or convey different things in different countries; for example closed captioning.

ACP
Macrovision's legacy analog copy protection (ACP) works by implanting a series of excessive voltage pulses within the off-screen VBI lines of video. These pulses were included physically within pre-existing recordings on VHS and Betamax, and were generated upon playback by a chip in DVD players and digital cable or satellite boxes. A DVD recorder receiving an analog signal featuring these pulses would detect them and display a message saying that the source is "copy-protected" followed by aborting the recording. VCRs, in turn, react to these excessive voltage pulses by compensating with their automatic gain control circuitry, causing the recorded picture to wildly change brightness, rendering it annoying to watch. The system was only effective on VCRs made at around the mid-1980s and later.

A later form of Macrovision's analog copy protection, called Level II ACP, introduced multiple 180-degree phase inversions to the analog signal's colorburst. Also known as colorstriping, this technology caused numerous off-color bands to appear within the picture.

Another form of analog copy protection, known as CGMS-A, is added by DVD players and digital cable/satellite boxes. While not invented by Macrovision, the company's products implemented it. CGMS-A consists of a "flag" within the vertical blanking interval (essentially data, like closed captioning) which digital recording devices search for. If present, it refused to record the signal, just as with the earlier ACP technology. Unlike digital recording equipment, however, analog VCRs do not respond to CGMS-A encoded video and would record it successfully if ACP is not also present. 

Historically, the original Macrovision technology was considered a nuisance to some specialist users because it could interfere with other electronic equipment. For example, if one were to run a video signal through a VCR before the television, some VCRs will output a ruined signal regardless of whether it is recording. This also occurs in some TV-VCR combo sets. Apart from this, many DVD recorders mistake the mechanical instability of worn videotapes for Macrovision signals, and so refuse to make what would be perfectly legal DVD dubs of people's old home movies and the like. This widespread problem is another factor contributing to the demand for devices that defeat Macrovision. The signal has also been known to confuse home theater line doublers (devices for improving the quality of video for large projection TVs) and some high-end television comb filters. In addition, Macrovision confuses many upconverters (devices that convert a video signal to a higher resolution), causing them to shut down and refuse to play Macrovision content. 

There are also devices called stabilizers, video stabilizers or enhancers available that filter out the Macrovision spikes and thereby defeat the system. The principle of their function lies in detecting the vertical synchronization signal, and forcing the lines occurring during the VBI to black level, removing the AGC-confusing pulses. They can be easily built by hobbyists, as nothing more than a cheap microcontroller together with an analog multiplexer and a little other circuitry is needed. Individuals less experienced with such things can purchase video stabilizers.

Discs made with DVD copying programs such as DVD Shrink automatically disable any Macrovision copy protection. The ease with which Macrovision and other copy protection measures can be defeated has prompted a steadily growing number of DVD releases that do not have copy protection of any kind, Content Scramble System (CSS) or Macrovision.

United States fair use law, as interpreted in the decision over Betamax (Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios), dictates that consumers are fully within their legal rights to copy videos they own. However, the legality has changed somewhat with the controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act. After April 26, 2002, no VCR may be manufactured or imported without Automatic Gain Control circuitry (which renders VCRs vulnerable to Macrovision). This is contained in title 17, section 1201(k) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. However, there are a number of mostly older VCR models on the market that are not affected by Macrovision.

On October 26, 2001, the sale, purchase, or manufacture of any device that has no commercial purpose other than disabling Macrovision copy protection was made illegal under section 1201(a) of the same controversial act.

In June 2005, Macrovision sent a cease and desist letter to "Lightning UK!", the maker of DVD Decrypter, a program that allows users to back up their DVDs by bypassing CSS and Macrovision. They later acquired the rights to this software.

In June 2005, Macrovision sued Sima Products under section 1201 of the DMCA, claiming that Sima's video processors provided a way to circumvent Macrovision's analog copy protection. Sima received an injunction barring the sale of this device, but the parties ultimately settled without a judgment on the legal issues.
