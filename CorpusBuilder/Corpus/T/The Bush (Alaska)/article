In Alaska, the bush is any region of the State not connected to the North American road network or ready access to the State's Ferry System. A majority of Alaska's native populations live in the bush, where they make their living in similar fashion to their ancestors.

Geographically, the bush comprises the Alaska North Slope; Northwest Arctic; West, including the Baldwin Peninsula and Seward Peninsula; the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta; Southwest Alaska; Bristol Bay; Alaska Peninsula; and remote areas of the Alaska Panhandle and Interior. 

Some of the larger communities in the bush include Bethel, Dillingham, King Salmon, Nome, Barrow, Katmai National Park, Kodiak Island, Kotzebue, and Unalaska-Dutch Harbor.

Most parts of Alaska that are off the road system can only be reached by a small bush airplane. Travel from place to place is typically accomplished by snowmobile, snow machine, boat, or dog sled.
