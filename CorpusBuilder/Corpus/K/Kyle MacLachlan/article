Early life
MacLachlan was born in Yakima, Washington. His mother, Catherine (née Stone), was a public relations director, and his father, Kent Alan MacLachlan, was a stockbroker and lawyer. He has Scottish, Cornish and German ancestry. He has two younger brothers named Craig and Kent, both of whom live in the Pacific Northwest. MacLachlan graduated from Eisenhower High School in Yakima in 1977. He graduated from the University of Washington in 1982 and, shortly afterward, moved to Hollywood, California to pursue his career.

Career
MacLachlan has worked extensively with David Lynch, with whom he has been friends for many years. He first appeared as Paul Atreides in the film Dune (1984), Lynch's adaptation of Frank Herbert's novel, and as Jeffrey Beaumont in Blue Velvet (1986). He starred in 1987s Science Fiction Action film The Hidden as FBI agent Lloyd Gallagher. Later he played Special Agent Dale Cooper in Lynch's ABC television series Twin Peaks (1990–1991), reprising that role for Lynch's 1992 prequel Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. Lynch commented on those roles in a GQ story about MacLachlan: "Kyle plays innocents who are interested in the mysteries of life. He's the person you trust enough to go into a strange world with."


In 1994, MacLachlan featured in The Flintstones, a live-action adaptation of the animated sitcom of the same name, portraying Cliff Vandercave, the movie's primary antagonist opposite John Goodman and Rick Moranis. In 1995, MacLachlan starred in Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls. The movie was heavily panned by critics and it collected seven Golden Raspberry Awards (from a record 13 nominations). MacLachlan himself was deeply embarrassed with his involvement; although some entertainment writers alleged that he walked out of the film's premiere, he personally contradicted these claims with the comment that he "suffered through the whole two hours" of the premiere.

MacLachlan has appeared in several plays, including John Kolvenbach's On an Average Day with Woody Harrelson, on Broadway in The Caretaker with Patrick Stewart, as well as in Romeo and Juliet and Henry V.
In recent years, MacLachlan continues to play dark or morally ambiguous characters. This included a guest role on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, in which he played a father who shot and killed a sociopathic child who had murdered his son. MacLachlan later had another guest role on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in 2011 as a different character. This time he portrayed the father of a boy who is murdered by his illegitimate half-brother. In the 1990s, MacLachlan was offered by NBC to be one of the lead actors on the then-new soap opera Passions as a powerful, wealthy villain and head of a multi-million dollar company, but MacLachlan turned it down. MacLachlan also lent his voice to the nefarious media mogul Donald Love in the video game Grand Theft Auto III. After starring in the short-lived In Justice, MacLachlan has become a regular on Desperate Housewives. His character, the mysterious dentist Orson Hodge, first appeared during the show's second season, and MacLachlan became a full-time cast member at the start of season three.

On July 7, 2007, MacLachlan was one of the presenters at the London leg of Live Earth. MacLachlan appeared in the 2008 movie The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2.
In the 2008 English language DVD re-release of the cult 2006 Norwegian animated film Free Jimmy, MacLachlan voiced the character of "Marius", a militant animal rights activist.

After four years of playing Orson Hodge, MacLachlan decided to quit Desperate Housewives. He decided to leave the show after having children, he found the commute from his home in New York City to the Desperate Housewives set in Los Angeles very difficult. However, MacLachlan returned to Desperate Housewives in season eight, the final season, to make one last appearance as a guest star. MacLachlan had also guest starred in season 6, 8 and 9 of How I Met Your Mother.

He currently has a role as the Mayor of Portland, Oregon, in the IFC comedy Portlandia and a recurring role on Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. television series as Calvin Zabo / The Doctor who is the father of the series regular's character Skye played by Chloe Bennet.

In 2015, MacLachlan can be seen in the Pixar animated feature Inside Out, voicing the main character's Dad. In January 2015, it was announced that MacLachlan would return as Special Agent Dale Cooper for the new episodes of the television series Twin Peaks.

Personal life
In 1993, Kyle met model Linda Evangelista on a fashion shoot for Barney's and the two began dating. Evangelista separated from her husband, Elite executive Gerald Marie. The two appeared in further fashion spreads in Vogue magazine. Around 1998 or 1999, the two were supposedly engaged. The couple split up however, when Evangelista met French soccer star Fabien Barthez and became pregnant by him.

MacLachlan married Desiree Gruber, an executive producer of Project Runway, in 2002; their son, Callum Lyon MacLachlan, was born July 26, 2008, in Los Angeles. MacLachlan lives in Manhattan with his family.

The couple have two small dogs (a Jack Russell terrier and a Yorkie/Chihuahua mixed breed) and out of "probably too much affection" have created a website about their dogs as well as a TV series popular on YouTube.

A dedicated wine lover, Kyle is partners with vintner Eric Dunham in Pursued by Bear, a winery in Washington's Columbia Valley. The name, suggested over dinner by Fred Savage, comes from a stage direction ("Exit, pursued by a bear") in Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale.
