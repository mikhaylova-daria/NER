The National Anthem of Chile is also known as Canción Nacional (National Song). It has a history of two lyrics and two melodies that made up three different versions. The current version was composed by Ramón Carnicer, with words by Eusebio Lillo, and has six parts plus the chorus.

 First National Anthem 
The first Chilean National Anthem dates back to 1819, when the government called for, on the 19th of July, the creation of music and lyrics for this purpose.

The composer Manuel Robles and the poet Bernardo de Vera y Pintado fulfilled this mandate and their "National Song" debuted on 20 August 1820 in the Domingo Arteaga theater, although other historians claim that it was played and sung during the festivities of September 1819.

In the beginning, everyone would stand for the song. O'Higgins and Freire listened to it with respect and full of emotion, for they had marched to victory to its tune more than once.

The custom of always singing it at the theater slowly disappeared, until it was ordered that it only be sung at the anniversary of the country.

The doctor Bernardo Vera, known in the history of the independence, was the author of the verses that were sung to Robles' music.

This first hymn was sung until 1828, when it was replaced with what is sung today.

 Second National Anthem 
The second Chilean National Anthem was composed by the Spanish composer Ramón Carnicer, when he was exiled in England because of his liberal ideas. Mariano Egaña, Chilean Minister in London, acting on the criticism that Robles' song was receiving, asked Carnicer to compose a new hymn with Bernardo de Vera's original text.

The Spanish musician probably wrote the work by 1827, the date he returned to Barcelona, and his hymn debuted in Santiago, in the Arteaga theater, 23 December 1828.

Years later, in 1847, the Chilean government entrusted the young poet Eusebio Lillo with a new text that would replace the anti-Spain poem of Vera y Pintado, and after being analyzed by Andrés Bello, retained the original chorus ("Dulce patria, recibe los votos..."). The lyrics were slightly revised in 1903.

During the military government (1973–1990) of Augusto Pinochet, the Verse III was officially incorporated because of his praise of the armed forces and the national police (Carabiners). After that, in 1990, it was eliminated from the anthem and only sung in military events as part of the full song. Supporters from the former military regime also sing the anthem with the Verse III in private ceremonies and rallies.

In the celebrations marking the return of democracy in March 1990 at Santiago's Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos, the anthem was played in its present melody, raised to F Major (the Royal Musical Official Version of the anthem) which is the original melody of the second anthem by Carnicer, but using the 1847 lyrics as text, save for the original chorus of the 1819 anthem. This was the version that from 1991 to 2013 was played during sign-on and sign-off broadcasts of Chilean television stations. Now the anthem is played in C Major during sign-on and sign-off.

Joe Walsh, famed musician who was part of the United States rock band the Eagles, sang the National Anthem of Chile at a Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim baseball game in 2003.

 Official version lyrics 

Below are the lyrics of the version most often played; it corresponds to Verse V of the full version and the chorus:Spanish originalTranslation
Puro, Chile, es tu cielo azulado.
Puras brisas te cruzan también.
Y tu campo de flores bordado
Es la copia feliz del Edén.
Majestuosa es la blanca montaña
Que te dio por baluarte el Señor
Que te dio por baluarte el Señor,
Y ese mar que tranquilo te baña
Te promete un futuro esplendor
Y ese mar que tranquilo te baña
Te promete un futuro esplendor.

Coro
Dulce Patria, recibe los votos
Con que Chile en tus aras juró:
Que o la tumba serás de los libres
O el asilo contra la opresión
Que o la tumba serás de los libres
O el asilo contra la opresión
Que o la tumba serás de los libres
O el asilo contra la opresión
O el asilo contra la opresión
O el asilo contra la opresión.
Pure, Chile, is your blue sky
Pure breezes cross you as well
And your flower-embroidered fields
Are the happy copy of Eden
Majestic is the white colored mountain
That was given to you as a bastion by the Lord
That was given to you as a bastion by the Lord
And that sea that quietly washes your shore
Promises you a future splendor
And that sea that quietly washes your shore
Promises you a future splendor

Chorus
Sweet Fatherland accept the vows
With which Chile swore at your altars
Either the tomb of the free you will be
Or the refuge against oppression
Either the tomb of the free you will be
Or the refuge against oppression
Either the tomb of the free you will be
Or the refuge against oppression
Or the refuge against oppression
Or the refuge against oppression

Dulce Patria, recibe los votos
con que Chile en tus aras juró
que o la tumba serás de los libres
o el asilo contra la opresión.


Sweet Fatherland accept the vows
With which Chile swore at your altars
Either the tomb of the free you will be
Or the refuge against oppression
 Verse I

Ha cesado la lucha sangrienta;
ya es hermano el que ayer invasor;
de tres siglos lavamos la afrenta
combatiendo en el campo de honor.
El que ayer doblegábase esclavo
hoy ya libre y triunfante se ve;
libertad es la herencia del bravo,
la Victoria se humilla a su pie.


The bloody fight has ceased; 
and yesterdays invader is now our brother;
three centuries we washed the affront
fighting in the field of honor.
That who yesterday was a slave
is free and triumphant today;
freedom is the heritage of the brave,
Victory lies shameful to his feet.
 Verse II

Alza, Chile, sin mancha la frente;
conquistaste tu nombre en la lid;
siempre noble, constante y valiente
te encontraron los hijos del Cid.
Que tus libres tranquilos coronen
a las artes, la industria y la paz,
y de triunfos cantares entonen
que amedrenten al déspota audaz.


Rise, Chile, with a spotless forehead;
you conquered your name on the fight;
always noble, constant and courageous
the children of the Cid found you.
May your free calmly crown
the arts, industry and peace,
and may they sing songs of your triumph
to intimidate the daring despot.
 Verse III 

Vuestros nombres, valientes soldados,
que habéis sido de Chile el sostén,
nuestros pechos los llevan grabados;
los sabrán nuestros hijos también.
Sean ellos el grito de muerte
que lancemos marchando a lidiar,
y sonando en la boca del fuerte
hagan siempre al tirano temblar.


Your names, brave soldiers
who have been Chile's mainstay,
they are engraved in our chests;
our children will know them as well.
May they be the death cry
that comes out when we march to the fight,
and ringing in the mouth of the strong
they always make the tyrant tremble.
 Verse IV

Si pretende el cañón extranjero
nuestros pueblos, osado, invadir;
desnudemos al punto el acero
y sepamos vencer o morir.
Con su sangre el altivo araucano
nos legó, por herencia, el valor;
y no tiembla la espada en la mano
defendiendo, de Chile, el honor.


If the foreign cannon intends
to invade, daring, our people;
let's draw our arms
and know victory or death.
With its blood the proud araucanian
inherited its courage to us;
and the sword doesn't tremble in the hand
of that who defends the honour of Chile.
 Verse V (Official version lyrics)

Puro, Chile, es tu cielo azulado,
puras brisas te cruzan también,
y tu campo de flores bordado
es la copia feliz del Edén.
Majestuosa es la blanca montaña
que te dio por baluarte el Señor,
Y ese mar que tranquilo te baña
te promete futuro esplendor.


Pure, Chile, your sky is blue
Pure breezes cross you as well
And your flower-embroidered fields
Are the happy copy of Eden
Majestic is the white mountain
That was given to you as a bastion by the Lord,
And that sea that quietly washes your shore
Promises you a splendid future
Verse VI

Esas galas, ¡oh, Patria!, esas flores
que tapizan tu suelo feraz,
no las pisen jamás invasores;
con tu sombra las cubra la paz.
Nuestros pechos serán tu baluarte,
con tu nombre sabremos vencer,
o tu noble, glorioso estandarte,
nos verá, combatiendo, caer.


That pride, oh, Fatherland!, those flowers
growing on your fertile soil,
may they never be stepped on by invaders;
may your shadow cover them with peace.
Our chests will be your bastion
in your name we will know how to win,
or your noble, glorious emblem
will see us fall in the fight.
