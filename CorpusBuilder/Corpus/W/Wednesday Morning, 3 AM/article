Wednesday Morning, 3 AM is the debut album by folk rock duo Simon & Garfunkel, released October 19, 1964. It was produced by Tom Wilson and engineered by Roy Halee. The cover and the label include the subtitle exciting new sounds in the folk tradition.

The album was initially unsuccessful, having been released in the shadow of The Beatles' arrival on the scene. This resulted in Paul Simon's move to England and Art Garfunkel's resumption of his university studies at Columbia University in New York City.

Wednesday Morning, 3 AM was re-released in January 1966 (to capitalize on their newly found radio success with a later re-mixed electric/acoustic version of the song "The Sound of Silence"), reaching number 30 on the Billboard album chart. It was belatedly released in the UK in 1968 in both mono and stereo formats.

The album is also included in its entirety as part of the Simon & Garfunkel box sets Collected Works and The Columbia Studio Recordings (1964–1970).
