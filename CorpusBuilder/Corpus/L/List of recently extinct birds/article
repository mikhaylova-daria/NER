Since 1500, over 190 species of birds have become extinct, and this rate of extinction seems to be increasing. The situation is exemplified by Hawaii, where 30% of all known recently extinct bird taxa originally lived. Other areas, such as Guam, have also been hit hard; Guam has lost over 60% of its native bird taxa in the last 30 years, many of them due to the introduced brown tree snake.

Currently there are approximately 10,000 species of birds, with an estimated 1,200 considered to be under threat of extinction.

Island species in general, and flightless island species in particular are most at risk. The disproportionate number of rails in the list reflects the tendency of that family to lose the ability to fly when geographically isolated. Even more rails became extinct before they could be described by scientists; these taxa are listed in Late Quaternary prehistoric birds.

The extinction dates given below are usually approximations of the actual date of extinction. In some cases, more exact dates are given as it is sometimes possible to pinpoint the date of extinction to a specific year or even day (the San Benedicto rock wren is possibly the most extreme example—its extinction could be timed with an accuracy of maybe half an hour). Extinction dates in the literature are usually the dates of the last verified record (credible observation or specimen taken); in many Pacific birds which became extinct shortly after European contact, however, this leaves an uncertainty period of over a century because the islands on which they used to occur were only rarely visited by scientists.


Extinct bird species

Struthioniformes
The ostrich and related ratites
* Elephant bird, Aepyornis maximus and/or A. medius (Madagascar, 16th century?)
*: The taxonomy of the elephant birds is not fully resolved; it is certain that at least one taxon survived until some 1000 years ago at least. Judging from geographical data, A. maximus and the smaller A. medius are possibilities.
* Upland moa, Megalapteryx didinus (South Island, New Zealand, late 15th century?)
*: Generally believed to have been extinct by 1500, this is the only moa species that according to current knowledge might have survived until later times, possibly as late as the 1830s.
* King Island emu, Dromaius ater (King Island, Australia, 1822)
*:Extinct in the wild c. 1805, the last captive specimen died in 1822 in the Jardin des Plantes.
* Kangaroo Island emu, Dromaius baudinianus (Kangaroo Island, Australia, 1827)
* West Coast spotted kiwi, Apteryx occidentalis (South Island, New Zealand, c. 1900)
*:A doubtful form known from a single bird; may be a little spotted kiwi subspecies or a hybrid between that species and the rowi.

Anseriformes
Ducks, geese and swans
* Crested shelduck, Tadorna cristata (Northeast Asia, late 20th century?)
*:A relict species from Northeast Asia. Officially critically endangered due to recent unconfirmed reports.
* Réunion shelduck, Alopochen kervazoi (Réunion, Mascarenes, c.1690s)
* Mauritian shelduck, Alopochen mauritianus (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c.1695)
* Amsterdam duck, Anas marecula (Amsterdam Island, South Indian Ocean, c.1800)
* Saint Paul Island duck, Anas sp. (Saint Paul Island, South Indian Ocean, c.1800)
*: Only known by a painting from 1793. Might be identical with the Amsterdam Island duck or a distinct species or subspecies.
* Mauritian duck, Anas theodori (Mauritius and Réunion, Mascarenes, late 1690s)
* Mariana mallard, Anas oustaleti (Marianas, West Pacific, 1981)
* Finsch's duck, Chenonetta finschi from New Zealand possibly survived to 1870
* Pink-headed duck, Rhodonessa caryophyllacea (East India, Bangladesh, North Myanmar, 1945?)– a reclassification into the genus Netta is recommended but not generally accepted.
*:Officially critically endangered; recent surveys have failed to rediscover it.
* Réunion pochard, Aythya cf. innotata (Réunion, Mascarenes, c.1690s)
*:A bone of a pochard found on Réunion seems to resolve the reports of canards other than the Mauritian duck having occurred on the island. The taxonomic status of this form cannot be resolved until more material is found, however.
* Labrador duck, Camptorhynchus labradorius (Northeast North America, c. 1880)
* Auckland merganser, Mergus australis (Auckland Islands, Southwest Pacific, c.1902)

Galliformes
Quails and relatives
See also Bokaak "bustard" under Gruiformes below
* The pile-builder megapode, Megapodius molistructor may have survived on New Caledonia to the late 18th century as evidenced by descriptions of the bird named "Tetrao australis" and later "Megapodius andersoni".
* The Viti Levu scrubfowl, Megapodius amissus of Viti Levu and possibly Kadavu, Fiji, may have survived to the early 19th or even the 20th century as suggested by circumstantial evidence.
* Raoul Island scrubfowl, Megapodius sp. (Raoul, Kermadec Islands, 1876)
*:A megapode is said to have inhabited Raoul Island until the population was wiped out in a volcanic eruption. It is not clear whether the birds represent a distinct taxon or derive from a prehistoric introduction by Polynesian seafarers.
* New Zealand quail, Coturnix novaezelandiae (New Zealand, 1875)
* Himalayan quail, Ophrysia superciliosa (North India, late 19th century?)
*:Officially critically endangered. Not recorded with certainty since 1876, but thorough surveys are still required, and there was a recent set of possible (though unlikely) sightings around Naini Tal in 2003. A little-known native name from Western Nepal probably refers to this bird, but for various reasons, no survey for Ophrysia has ever been conducted in that country, nor is it generally assumed to occur there (due to the native name being overlooked).

Charadriiformes
Shorebirds, gulls and auks
* Javan lapwing, Vanellus macropterus (Java, Indonesia, mid-20th century)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered, but as this conspicuous bird has not been recorded since 1940, it is almost certainly extinct.
* Tahiti sandpiper, Prosobonia leucoptera (Tahiti, Society Islands, 19th century)
* White-winged sandpiper, Prosobonia ellisi (Moorea, Society Islands, 19th century)
*:Doubtfully distinct from P. leucoptera.
* North Island snipe, Coenocorypha barrierensis (North Island, New Zealand, 1870s)
* South Island snipe, Coenocorypha iredalei (South and Stewart Islands, New Zealand, 1964)
* Eskimo curlew, Numenius borealis (Northern North America, late 20th century?)
*:May still exist; officially classified as critically endangered, possibly extinct.
* Slender-billed curlew, Numenius tenuirostris (Western Siberia, early first decade of the 21st century?)
*:May still exist; officially classified as critically endangered. A few birds were recorded in 2004, following several decades of increasing rarity. There was an unconfirmed sighting in Albania in 2007. A survey to find out whether this bird still exists is currently being undertaken by the RSPB (BirdLife in the UK).
* Great auk, Pinguinus impennis (Iceland, 1844)
* Canary Islands oystercatcher, Haematopus meadewaldoi (Eastern Canary Islands, E Atlantic, c. 1940?)
*:Later sightings of black oystercatchers off Senegal were not likely to be of this sedentary species, but two records from Tenerife - the last in 1981 - may be.

Gruiformes
Rails and allies - probably paraphyletic
* "Leguat's giant" or géant, a hypothetical giant rail from the Mascarenes described as Leguatia gigantea, is based on his descriptions of flamingos, as Leguat was not familiar with their French name flamand or thought that it referred to other birds (it was in his time sometimes used for spoonbills, for example).
* Antillean cave rail, Nesotrochis debooyi known by pre-Columbian bones from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Stories of an easy-to-catch bird named carrao heard by Alexander Wetmore in 1912 on Puerto Rico might refer to this species.
* Hawkins's rail, Diaphorapteryx hawkinsi (Chatham Islands, SW Pacific, 19th century)
* Red rail, Aphanapteryx bonasia (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c. 1700)
* Rodrigues rail, Aphanapteryx leguati (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)
* Bar-winged rail, Nesoclopeus poecilopterus (Fiji, Polynesia, c. 1980)
* New Caledonian rail, Gallirallus lafresnayanus (New Caledonia, Melanesia, c. 1990?)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered, the last records were in 1984 and it seems that all available habitat is overrun by feral pigs and dogs, which prey on this bird.
* Wake Island rail, Gallirallus wakensis (Wake Island, Micronesia, 1945)
* Image:Gallirallus.pacificus.jpg|thumb|Tahitian red-billed railTahitian red-billed rail, Gallirallus pacificus (Tahiti, Society Islands, late 18th– 19th century)
* Dieffenbach's rail, Gallirallus dieffenbachii (Chatham Islands, SW Pacific, mid-19th century)
* Tongatapu rail, Gallirallus hypoleucus (Tongatapu, Tonga, late 18th - 19th century)
* Vava'u rail, Gallirallus cf. vekamatolu (Vava'u, Tonga, early 19th century?)
*:This bird is known only from a drawing by the 1793 Malaspina expedition, apparently depicting a species of Gallirallus. The 'Eua rail, Gallirallus vekamatolu, is known from prehistoric bones found on 'Eua, but this species is almost certainly not G. vekamatolu, as that bird was flightless and hence is unlikely to have settled 3 distant islands. However, it probably was a close relative.
* Norfolk rail, Gallirallus sp. may be the bird shown on a bad watercolor illustration made around 1800.
* Chatham rail, Cabalus modestus (Chatham Islands, SW Pacific, c. 1900)
* Réunion rail or Dubois's wood-rail, Dryolimnas augusti (Réunion, Mascarenes, late 17th century)
* Ascension crake, Mundia elpenor (Ascension, Island, Atlantic, late 17th century)– formerly Atlantisia
* Saint Helena crake, Porzana astrictocarpus (Saint Helena, Atlantic, early 16th century)
* Image:Laysanralle.jpg|thumb|The Laysan rail was an omnivoreLaysan rail, Porzana palmeri (Laysan Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1944)
* Image:Hawaiirail.jpg|thumb|Hawaiian railHawaiian rail, Porzana sandwichensis (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, c. 1890)
* Kosrae crake, Porzana monasa (Kosrae, Carolines, c. mid-late 19th century)
* Miller's rail, Porzana nigra (Tahiti, Society Islands, c. 1800)
*:Known only from paintings and descriptions; taxonomic status uncertain as the material is often believed to refer to the extant spotless crake.
* Saint Helena swamphen, Aphanocrex podarces (Saint Helena, Atlantic, 16th century)– formerly Atlantisia
* Image:PorphyrioAlbus.jpg|thumb|Lord Howe swamphenLord Howe swamphen, Porphyrio albus (Lord Howe Island, SW Pacific, early 19th century)
* Réunion swamphen or Oiseau bleu, Porphyrio coerulescens (Réunion, Mascarenes, 18th century)
*:Known only from descriptions. Former existence of a Porphyrio on Réunion is fairly certain, but not proven to date.
* Marquesas swamphen, Porphyrio paepae (Hiva Oa and Tahuata, Marquesas)
*:May have survived to c. 1900. In the lower right corner of Paul Gauguin's 1902 painting Le Sorcier d'Hiva Oa ou le Marquisien à la cape rouge there is a bird which resembles native descriptions of P. paepae.
* The North Island takahē, Porphyrio mantelli known from subfossil bones found on North Island, New Zealand, may have survived to 1894 or later.
* New Caledonian gallinule, Porphyrio kukwiedei from New Caledonia, Melanesia, may have survived into historic times. The native name n'dino is thought to refer to this bird.
* Samoan wood rail, Gallinula pacifica (Savai'i, Samoa, 1907?)
*:Probably better placed in the genus Pareudiastes, unconfirmed reports from the late 20th century suggest it still survives in small numbers, and therefore it is officially classified as critically endangered.
* Makira woodhen, Gallinula silvestris (Makira, Solomon Islands, mid-20th century?)
*:Only known from a single specimen, this rail is probably better placed in its own genus, Edithornis. There are some unconfirmed recent records that suggest it still survives, and thus it is officially classified as critically endangered.
* Tristan moorhen, Gallinula nesiotis (Tristan da Cunha, Atlantic, late 19th century)
* Mascarene coot, Fulica newtonii (Mauritius and Réunion, Mascarenes, c. 1700)
* Fernando de Noronha rail, Rallidae gen. et sp. indet. (Fernando de Noronha, W. Atlantic, 16th century?)
*:A distinct species of rail inhabited Fernando de Noronha island, but it has not been formally described yet. Probably was extant at first Western contact.
* Tahitian "goose", Rallidae gen. et sp. indet. (Tahiti, late 18th century?)
*:Early travelers to Tahiti reported a "goose" that was found in the mountains. Altogether, a species of the rail genus Porphyrio seems the most likely choice.
* Bokaak "bustard", Rallidae? gen. et sp. indet. 'Bokaak'
*:An unidentified terrestrial bird is mentioned in an early report from Bokaak in the Marshall Islands. It is described as a "bustard" and may have been a rail or a megapode. In the former case it may have been a vagrant of some still-extant species; in any case, no bird that could be described as "bustard-like" is found on Bokaak today.
* Rallidae gen. et sp. indet. 'Amsterdam Island'
*:Unknown rail from Amsterdam Island, one specimen found but not recovered. Extinct by 1800 or may have been straggler of extant species.

Podicipediformes
Grebes
* Colombian grebe, Podiceps andinus (Bogotá area, Colombia, 1977)
* Alaotra grebe, Tachybaptus rufolavatus (Lake Alaotra, Madagascar, 1985)
*:Officially declared extinct in 2010, 25 years after the last official sighting. Declined through habitat destruction and hybridization with the little grebe. Disappeared from only known location in the 1980s.
* Atitlán grebe, Podilymbus gigas (Lake Atitlán, Guatemala, 1989)

Ciconiiformes
Herons and related birds - possibly paraphyletic
* The "painted vulture", Sarcoramphus sacra, a Floridian bird supposedly similar to the king vulture, seems based on a misidentification of the northern caracara. See King vulture article for discussion.
* Bermuda night heron, Nyctanassa carcinocatactes (Bermuda, West Atlantic, 17th century)
*:Sometimes assigned to the genus Nycticorax
* Réunion night heron, Nycticorax duboisi (Réunion, Mascarenes, late 17th century)
* Mauritius night heron, Nycticorax mauritianus (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c. 1700)
* Rodrigues night heron, Nycticorax megacephalus (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)
* Ascension night heron, Nycticorax olsoni (Ascension Island, Atlantic, late 16th century?)
*:Known only from subfossil bones, but the description of a flightless Ascension bird by André Thévet cannot be identified with anything other than this species.
* New Zealand little bittern, Ixobrychus novaezelandiae (New Zealand, late 19th century)
*:Long considered to be vagrant individuals of the Australian little bittern, bones recovered from Holocene deposits indicate that this was indeed a distinct taxon, but it might not be a separate species.
* Réunion ibis, Threskiornis solitarius (Réunion, Mascarenes, early 18th century)
*:This species was the basis of the "Réunion solitaire", a supposed relative of the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire. Given the fact that ibis (but no dodo-like) bones were found on Réunion and that old descriptions match a flightless sacred ibis quite well, the "Réunion solitaire" hypothesis has been refuted.

Pelecaniformes
Cormorants and related birds
* Spectacled cormorant, Phalacrocorax perspicillatus (Komandorski Islands, North Pacific, c. 1850)

Procellariiformes
Petrels, shearwaters, albatrosses and storm petrels.
* Olson's petrel, Bulweria bifax (Saint Helena, Atlantic, early 16th century)
* Bermuda shearwater, Puffinus parvus (Bermuda, West Atlantic, 16th century)
* Saint Helena petrel, Pseudobulweria rupinarum (Saint Helena, Atlantic, early 16th century)
* Jamaica petrel, Pterodroma caribbaea (Jamaica, Caribbean)
*:Possibly a subspecies of the black-capped petrel; unconfirmed reports suggest it might survive. Officially classified as critically endangered, possibly extinct.
* Pterodroma cf. leucoptera (Mangareva, Gambier Islands, 20th century?)
*:A wing of a carcass similar to Gould's petrel was recovered on Mangareva in 1922, where it possibly bred. No such birds are known to exist there today.
* Guadalupe storm petrel, Oceanodroma macrodacyla (Guadalupe, East Pacific, 1910s)
*:Officially critically endangered, possibly extinct, but a thorough survey in 2000 concluded the species was certainly extinct.

Sphenisciformes
Penguins
* The Chatham penguin, Eudyptes sp. (Chatham Islands, SW Pacific), is only known from subfossil bones, but a bird kept captive at some time between 1867 and 1872 might refer to this taxon.

Columbiformes
Pigeons, doves and dodos
For the "Réunion solitaire", see Réunion sacred ibis.
* Saint Helena dove, Dysmoropelia dekarchiskos, possibly survived into the Modern Era.
* Passenger pigeon, Ectopistes migratorius (Eastern North America, 1914)
*:The passenger pigeon was once among the most common birds in the world, a single flock numbering up to 2.2 billion birds. It was hunted close to extinction for food and sport in the late 19th century. The last individual died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914.
* Bonin woodpigeon, Columba versicolor (Nakodo-jima and Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands, c. 1890)
* Ryukyu woodpigeon, Columba jouyi (Okinawa and Daito Islands, Northwest Pacific, late 1930s)
* Réunion pink pigeon, Nesoenas duboisi (Réunion, Mascarenes, c. 1700)
*:Formerly in Streptopelia. There seems to have been at least another species of pigeon on Réunion (probably an Alectroenas), but bones have not yet been found. It disappeared at the same time.
* Rodrigues pigeon, Nesoenas rodericana (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, before 1690?)
*:Formerly in Streptopelia. A possible subspecies of the Madagascar turtle dove (N. picturata), this seems not to be the bird observed by Leguat. Introduced rats might have killed it off in the late 17th century.
* Liverpool pigeon, "Caloenas" maculata
*:Also known as the spotted green pigeon, the only known specimen has been in Liverpool Museum since 1851 and was probably collected on a Pacific island for Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby. It has been suggested that this bird came from Tahiti based on native lore about a somewhat similar extinct bird called the titi, but this has not been verified.
* Sulu bleeding-heart, Gallicolumba menagei (Tawitawi, Philippines, late 1990s?)
*:Officially listed as critically endangered. Only known from two specimens taken in 1891. There have been a number of unconfirmed reports from all over the Sulu Archipelago in 1995, however, these reports stated that the bird had suddenly undergone a massive decline, and by now, habitat destruction is almost complete. If not extinct, this species is very rare, but the ongoing civil war prevents comprehensive surveys.
* Norfolk ground dove, Gallicolumba norfolciensis (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1800)
* Tanna ground dove, Gallicolumba ferruginea (Tanna, Vanuatu, late 18th-19th century)
*:Only known from descriptions of two now-lost specimens.
* Thick-billed ground dove, Gallicolumba salamonis (Makira and Ramos, Solomon Islands, mid-20th century?)
*:Last recorded in 1927, only two specimens exist. Declared extinct in 2005.
* Image:Microgoura meeki.jpg|thumb|Choiseul crested pigeonChoiseul pigeon, Microgoura meeki (Choiseul, Solomon Islands, early 20th century)
* Red-moustached fruit dove, Ptilinopus mercierii (Nuku Hiva and Hiva Oa, Marquesas, mid-20th century)
*:Two subspecies, the little-known P. m. mercierii of Nuku Hiva (extinct mid-late 19th century) and P. m. tristrami of Hiva Oa.
* Negros fruit dove, Ptilinopus arcanus (Negros, Philippines, late 20th century?)
*:Known only from one specimen taken at the only documented sighting in 1953, the validity of this species has been questioned, but no good alternative to distinct species status has been proposed. Officially critically endangered, it might occur on Panay, but no survey has located it. One possible record in 2002 does not seem to have been repeated.
* File:Extinctbirds1907 P22 Alectroenas nitidissima0325.png|thumb|Mauritius blue pigeonMauritius blue pigeon, Alectroenas nitidissima (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c. 1830s)
* Farquhar blue pigeon, Alectroenas sp. (Farquhar Group, Seychelles, 19th century)
*:Only known from early reports; possibly a subspecies of the Comoro or Seychelles blue pigeon.
* Rodrigues grey pigeon, "Alectroenas" rodericana (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)
*:A mysterious bird of unknown affinities, known from a few bones and, as it seems, two historical reports.
* Dodo, Raphus cucullatus (Mauritius, Mascarenes, late 17th century)
*:Called Didus ineptus by Linnaeus. A meter-high flightless bird found on Mauritius. Its forest habitat was lost when Dutch settlers moved to the island and the dodo's nests were destroyed by the monkeys, pigs, and cats the Dutch brought with them. The last specimen was killed in 1681, only 80 years after the arrival of the new predators.
* Rodrigues solitaire, Pezophaps solitaria (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, c. 1730)

Psittaciformes
Parrots
* New Caledonian lorikeet, Charmosyna diadema (New Caledonia, Melanesia, mid-20th century?)
*:Officially critically endangered, there have been no reliable reports of this bird since the early 20th century. It is, however, small and inconspicuous.
* Image:John-Gould-001.jpg|thumb|Norfolk kakaNorfolk kaka, Nestor productus (Norfolk and Philip Islands, SW Pacific, 1851?)
* Society parakeet, Cyanoramphus ulietanus (Raiatea, Society Islands, late 18th century)
* Black-fronted parakeet, Cyanoramphus zealandicus (Tahiti, Society Islands, c. 1850)
* Paradise parrot, Psephotus pulcherrimus (Rockhampton area, Australia, late 1920s)
* Oceanic eclectus parrot, Eclectus infectus, known from subfossil bones found on Tonga, Vanuatu, and possibly Fiji, may have survived until the 18th century: a bird which seems to be a male Eclectus parrot was drawn in a report on the Tongan island of Vavaʻu by the Malaspina expedition. Also a 19th-century Tongan name ʻāʻā ("parrot") for "a beautiful bird found only at ʻEua" is attested (see here under "kaka"). This seems to refer either E. infectus which in Tonga is only known from Vavaʻu and ʻEua, or the extirpated population of the collared lory which also occurred there. It is possible but unlikely that the species survived on ʻEua until the 19th century.
* Image:Psittacula.wardi.jgk.jpg|thumb|Seychelles parakeetSeychelles parakeet, Psittacula wardi (Seychelles, W Indian Ocean, 1883)
* Newton's parakeet, Psittacula exsul (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, c. 1875)
* Mascarene grey parakeet, Psittacula bensoni (Mauritius, possible Réunion as Psittacula cf bensoni). Formerly described as Mauritius grey parrot, Lophopsittacus bensoni. Known from a 1602 sketch by Captain Willem van Westzanen and by subfossil bones described by David Thomas Holyoak in 1973. Might have survived to the mid-18th century.
* Mascarene parrot, Mascarinus mascarinus (Réunion and possibly Mauritius, Mascarenes, 1834?)
*:Last known individual was a captive bird which was alive before 1834.
* Broad-billed parrot, Lophopsittacus mauritianus (Mauritius, Mascarenes, 1680?)
*:May have survived to the late 18th century.
* Rodrigues parrot, Necropsittacus rodericanus (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, late 18th century)
*:The species N. francicus is fictional, N. borbonicus most likely so.
* Glaucous macaw, Anodorhynchus glaucus (N Argentina, early 20th century)
*:Officially critically endangered due to persistent rumors of wild birds, but probably extinct.
* Cuban macaw, Ara tricolor (Cuba, West Indies, late 19th century)
*:A number of related species have been described from the West Indies, but are not based on good evidence. Several prehistoric forms are now known to have existed in the region, however.
* Carolina parakeet, Conuropsis carolinensis (SE North America, c. 1930?)
*:Although the date of the last captive bird's death in the Cincinnati Zoo, 1918, is generally given as its extinction date, there are convincing reports of some wild populations persisting until later. Two subspecies, C. c. carolinensis (east and south of the Appalachian range– extinct 1918 or c. 1930) and C. c. ludovicianus (Louisiana parakeet, west of the Appalachian range– extinct early 1910s).
* Guadeloupe parakeet, Aratinga labati (Guadeloupe, West Indies, late 18th century)
*:Only known from descriptions, the former existence of this bird is likely for biogeographic reasons and because details as described cannot be referred to known species.
* Martinique amazon, Amazona martinica (Martinique, West Indies, mid-18th century)
* Guadeloupe amazon, Amazona violacea (Guadeloupe, West Indies, mid-18th century)
*:The extinct amazon parrots were originally described after travelers' descriptions. Both are now considered valid extinct species closely related to the imperial amazon.

Cuculiformes
Cuckoos
* Delalande's coua, Coua delalandei (Madagascar, late 19th century?)
* Saint Helena cuckoo, Nannococcyx psix (Saint Helena, Atlantic, 18th century)

Falconiformes
Birds of prey
* Guadalupe caracara, Polyborus lutosus (Guadelupe, E Pacific, 1900 or 1903)
* Réunion kestrel, Falco duboisi (Réunion, Mascarenes, c. 1700)

Strigiformes
Typical owls and barn-owls.
* Réunion owl, Mascarenotus grucheti (Réunion, Mascarenes, late 17th century?)
* Mauritius owl, Mascarenotus sauzieri (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c. 1850)
* Rodrigues owl, Mascarenotus murivorus (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)
*:The preceding two species were variously placed in Bubo, Athene, "Scops" (=Otus), Strix, and Tyto before their true affinity was realized.
* New Caledonian boobook, Ninox cf. novaeseelandiae (New Caledonia, Melanesia)
*:Known only from prehistoric bones, but might still survive.
* Laughing owl, Sceloglaux albifacies (New Zealand, 1914?)
*:Two subspecies, S. a. albifacies (South Island and Stewart Island, extinct 1914?) and S. a. rufifacies (North Island, extinct c. 1870s?)– circumstantial evidence suggests small remnants survived until the early/mid-20th century.
* The Puerto Rican barn owl, Tyto cavatica, known from prehistoric remains found in caves of Puerto Rico, West Indies, may still have existed in 1912 given reports of the presence of cave-roosting owls.
* The Bahaman barn owl, Tyto pollens, known from prehistoric remains found on Andros (Bahamas), may have survived to the 16th century as indicated by the "chickcharnie" legend.
* Siau scops owl Otus siaoensis (20th century?)
*: Only known from the holotype collected in 1866. Endemic to the small volcanic island of Siau north of Sulawesi in Indonesia. Might still survive as there are ongoing rumors of scops-owls at Siau.

Caprimulgiformes
Caprimulgidae - nightjars and nighthawks
Reclusive ground-nesting birds that sally out at night to hunt for large insects and similar prey. They are easily located by the males' song, but this is not given all year. Habitat destruction represents currently the biggest threat, while island populations are threatened by introduced mammalian predators, notably dogs, cats, pigs and mongoose.
* Jamaican poorwill, Siphonorhis americana (Jamaica, West Indies, late 19th century?)
*:Reports of unidentifiable nightjars from the 1980s in habitat appropriate for S. americana suggest that this cryptic species may still exist. Research into this possibility is currently underway; pending further information, it is classified as critically endangered, possibly extinct.
* Cuban pauraque, Siphonorhis daiquiri (Cuba, West Indies, prehistoric?)
*:Described from subfossil bones in 1985. There are persistent rumors that this bird, which was never seen alive by scientists, may still survive. Compare Puerto Rican nightjar and preceding.
* Vaurie's nightjar (Caprimulgus centralasicus) is only known from a single 1929 specimen from Xinjiang, China. It has never been found again, but the validity of this supposed species is seriously disputed. It was never refuted to be an immature female desert European nightjar.

Apodiformes
Swifts and hummingbirds
* Coppery thorntail, Discosura letitiae (Bolivia?)
*:Known only from three trade specimens of unknown origin. Might still exist.
* Brace's emerald, Chlorostilbon bracei (New Providence, Bahamas, late 19th century)
* Gould's emerald, Chlorostilbon elegans (Jamaica or northern Bahamas, West Indies, late 19th century)
* Bogota sunangel, Heliangelus zusii (Colombia?)
*:A mysterious bird known only from a single specimen of unknown origin. Long considered a hybrid but confirmed as a valid species in 2009 through DNA analysis.
* Turquoise-throated puffleg, Eriocnemis godini (Ecuador, 20th century?)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered, possibly extinct. Known only from six pre-1900 specimens, the habitat at the only known site where it occurred has been destroyed. However, the bird's distribution remains unresolved.

Coraciiformes
Kingfishers and related birds
* Saint Helena hoopoe, Upupa antaois (Saint Helena, Atlantic, early 16th century)

Piciformes
Woodpeckers and related birds
* Imperial woodpecker, Campephilus imperialis (Mexico, late 20th century)
*:This 60-centimeter-long woodpecker is officially listed as critically endangered, possibly extinct. Occasional unconfirmed reports come up, the most recent in late 2005.
* The ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis principalis) is most likely extinct, but there is uncertainty on whether it was or was not rediscovered in the White River National Wildlife Refuge of Arkansas in 2004, as intensive searching in the five following years has failed to confirm its survival. The Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis bairdii) was last seen in 1987 and is generally considered extinct, but there are a few patches of habitat not yet surveyed.

Passeriformes
Perching birds
Acanthisittidae– New Zealand "wrens"
* Stephens Island wren, Xenicus lyalli (New Zealand, 1895?)
*:The species famously (but erroneously) claimed to have been made extinct by a single cat named "Tibbles".
* Bushwren, Xenicus longipes (New Zealand, 1972)
*:Three subspecies: X. l. stokesi (North Island, extinct 1955); X. l. longipes (South Island, extinct 1968); X. l. variabilis (Stewart Island, extinct 1972).

Formicariidae – antpittas and antthrushes
* Táchira antpitta, Grallaria chthonia (Venezuela, late 20th century?)
*:Officially critically endangered, this species has not been recorded since 1956 and although some habitat still exists, it was not found in dedicated searches in the 1990s. Nevertheless, its voice – generally the primary means of locating antpittas – remains unknown, making surveys difficult.

Mohoidae – Hawaiian "honeyeaters". Family established in 2008, previously in Meliphagidae.
* Kioea, Chaetoptila angustipluma (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1860s)
* Image:Moho nobilis-Keulemans.jpg|thumb|Hawaiʻi ʻōʻōHawaiʻi ʻōʻō, Moho nobilis (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1930s)
* Oʻahu ʻōʻō, Moho apicalis (Oʻahu, Hawaiian Islands, mid-19th century)
* Molokaʻi ʻōʻō, Moho bishopi (Molokaʻi and probably Maui, Hawaiian Islands, c. 1910 or 1980s)
* Kauaʻi ʻōʻō, Moho braccatus (Kauaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, 1987)

Meliphagidae – honeyeaters and Australian chats
* Chatham bellbird, Anthornis melanocephala (Chatham Islands, Southwest Pacific, c. 1910)
*:Sometimes regarded as subspecies of the New Zealand bellbird, Anthornis melanura. Unconfirmed records exist from the early-mid-1950s.
* The identity of "Strigiceps leucopogon" (an invalid name), described by Lesson in 1840, is unclear. Apart from the holotype supposedly from "New Holland", a second specimen from the "Himalaya" may have existed (or still exist). Lesson tentatively allied it to the Meliphagidae, and Rothschild felt reminded of the kioea.

Acanthizidae – scrubwrens, thornbills, and gerygones
* Lord Howe gerygone, Gerygone insularis (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1930)

Pachycephalidae – whistlers, shrike-thrushes, pitohuis and allies
* Mangarevan whistler, ?Pachycephala gambierana (Mangareva, Gambier Islands, late 19th century?)

Dicruridae – monarch flycatchers and allies
* Maupiti monarch, Pomarea pomarea (Maupiti, Society Islands, mid-19th century)
* Eiao monarch, Pomarea fluxa (Eiao, Marquesas, late 1970s)
*:Previously considered a subspecies of the Iphis monarch, this is an early offspring of the Marquesan stock.
* Nuku Hiva monarch, Pomarea nukuhivae (Nuku Hiva, Marquesas, mid-late 20th century)
*:Previously considered a subspecies of the Marquesas monarch, this is another early offspring of the Marquesan stock.
* Ua Pou monarch, Pomarea mira (Ua Pou, Marquesas, c. 1986)
*:Previously considered another subspecies of the Marquesas monarch, this was a distinct species most closely related to that bird and the Fatuhiva monarch.
* Guam flycatcher, Myiagra freycineti (Guam, Marianas, 1983)

†Turnagridae – piopios
* North Island piopio, Turnagra tanagra	(North Island, New Zealand, c. 1970?)

* Huia, Heteralocha acutirostris (North Island, New Zealand, early 20th century)

Hirundinidae – swallows and martins
* White-eyed river martin, Pseudochelidon sirintarae (Thailand, late 1980s?)

* Red Sea cliff swallow, Petrochelidon perdita (Red Sea area, late 20th century?)
*:Known from a single specimen, this enigmatic swallow probably still exists, but the lack of recent records is puzzling. It is alternatively placed in the genus Hirundo.

Acrocephalidae – marsh and tree warblers
* Nightingale reed warbler, Acrocephalus luscinius (Guam, c. 1970's)
* Aguiguan reed warbler, Acrocephalus nijoi (Aguiguan, Marianas, c. 1997)

* Pagan reed warbler, Acrocephalus yamashinae (Pagan, Marianas, 1970s)
* Garrett's reed warbler, Acrocephalus musae (Society Islands, 19th century?)

Muscicapidae – Old World flycatchers and chats
* Rück's blue flycatcher, Cyornis ruckii (Malaysia or Indochina, 20th century?)
*:An enigmatic bird known from two or four possibly migrant specimens, last recorded in 1918. Might exist in northeast Indochina and might be a subspecies of the Hainan blue flycatcher.

Megaluridae – megalurid warblers or grass warblers
* Chatham fernbird, Bowdleria rufescens (Chatham Islands, New Zealand, c. 1900)
*:Often placed in genus Megalurus, but this is based on an incomplete review of the evidence.

Cisticolidae – cisticolas and allies
* Tana River cisticola, Cisticola restrictus (Kenya, 1970s?)
*:A mysterious bird, found in the Tana River basin in small numbers at various dates, but not since 1972. Probably invalid, based on aberrant or hybrid specimens. An unconfirmed sighting was apparently made in 2007 in the Tana River Delta.

Zosteropidae – white-eyes - probably belonging to Timaliidae
* Marianne white-eye, Zosterops semiflavus (Marianne Island, Seychelles, late 19th century) 
* Lord Howe white-eye, Zosterops strenuus (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1918)

Timaliidae – Old World babblers
* Black-browed babbler, Malacocincla perspicillata (Borneo?, Indonesia, 20th century?)
*:Known from a single mid-19th century specimen, this bird may be extinct or could still exist. If the specimen label, usually considered erroneous in claiming "Java" as the bird's origin, is correct, it may have gone extinct earlier.

Pycnonotidae – bulbuls
* Rodrigues bulbul, ?Hypsipetes sp. (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, 17th century?)
*:Known only from subfossil bones.

Sylvioidea incertae sedis
* Aldabra brush warbler, Nesillas aldabrana (Aldabra, Indian Ocean, c. 1984)
* Rodrigues "babbler" (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, 17th century?)
*:Known from subfossil bones. Provisionally assigned to Timaliidae, but placement highly doubtful.

* Kosrae starling, Aplonis corvina (Kosrae, Carolines, mid-19th century)
* Mysterious starling, Aplonis mavornata (Mauke, Cook Islands, mid-19th century)
* Tasman starling, Aplonis fusca (Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1923)
*:Two subspecies, A. f. fusca– Norfolk Island starling (extinct c. 1923); A. fusca hulliana– Lord Howe starling (extinct c. 1919).
* Pohnpei starling, Aplonis pelzelni (Pohnpei, Micronesia, c. 2000)
*:Only one reliable record since 1956, in 1995, leaves the species' survival seriously in doubt.
* Bay starling, Aplonis? ulietensis (Raiatea, Society Islands, between 1774 and 1850)
*:Usually called "bay thrush" (Turdus ulietensis); a mysterious bird from Raiatea, now only known from a painting and some descriptions of a (now lost) specimen. Its taxonomic position is thus unresolvable at present, although for biogeographic reasons and because of the surviving description, it has been suggested to have been a honeyeater. However, with the discovery of fossils of the prehistorically extinct starling Aplonis diluvialis on neighboring Huahine, it seems likely that this bird also belonged to this genus.
* Hoopoe starling, Fregilupus varius (Réunion, Mascarenes, 1850s)
*:Tentatively assigned to Sturnidae
* Rodrigues starling, Necropsar rodericanus (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century?)
*:Tentatively assigned to Sturnidae. The bird variously described as Necropsar leguati or Orphanopsar leguati and considered to be identical with N. rodericanus (which is only known from subfossil bones) was found to be based on a misidentified albinistic specimen of the Martinique trembler (Cinclocerthia gutturalis)

Turdidae – thrushes and allies
* Grand Cayman thrush, Turdus ravidus (Grand Cayman, West Indies, late 1940s)
* Bonin thrush, Zoothera terrestris (Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands, c. 1830s)

* Olomaʻo, Myadestes lanaiensis (Hawaiian Islands, 1980s?)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered because a possible location on Molokaʻi remains unsurveyed. Two subspecies are known from Lanaʻi (M. l. lanaiensis, extinct early 1930s), Molokaʻi (M. l. rutha, extinct 1980s?) and a possible third subspecies from Maui (extinct before late 19th century).

Mimidae – mockingbirds and thrashers
*Cozumel thrasher, Toxostoma guttatum (Cozumel, Caribbean, early first decade of the 21st century?)
*:It is still unknown whether the tiny population rediscovered in 2004 survived Hurricanes Emily and Wilma in 2005. Unconfirmed records in April 2006 and October and December 2007.

Estrildidae– estrildid finches (waxbills, munias, etc.)
* Black-lored waxbill, Estrilda nigriloris (D.R. Congo, Africa, late 20th century?)

* Bonin grosbeak, Chaunoproctus ferreorostris (Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands, 1830s)
* ʻŌʻū, Psittirostra psittacea (Hawaiian Islands, c. 2000?)

* Hawaiʻi ʻakialoa or lesser ʻakialoa, Hemignathus obscurus (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1940)
*:Sometimes placed in genus Akialoa (as A. obscura).
* Greater ʻakialoa, Hemignathus ellisianus (Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Lanaʻi and prehistorically probably Maui and Molokaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, 1969)
*:Sometimes placed in genus Akialoa (as A. ellisiana). Often split into Maui Nui ʻakialoa, H. lanaiensis or A. lanaiensis (Lanaʻi and prehistorically probably Maui and Molokaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, extinct 1892), Oʻahu ʻakialoa, H. ellisianus or A. ellisiana (Oʻahu, Hawaiian Islands, extinct 1940) and Kauaʻi ʻakialoa, H. stejnegeri or A. stejnegeri (Kauaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, extinct 1969).

* Antioquia brush finch, Atlapetes blancae (Antioquia, Colombia, late 20th century?)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered. A mysterious bird, formerly misidentified as slaty brush finch and only described in 2007. Not found in recent surveys; may be extinct due to rampant habitat destruction.
*Bermuda towhee, Pipilo naufragus. Known by subfossil remains and possibly from a travel report by William Strachey in 1610.

(Probably) Extinct subspecies of birds
Extinction of subspecies is a subject very dependent on guesswork. National and international conservation projects and research publications such as redlists usually focus on species as a whole. Reliable information on the status of threatened subspecies usually has to be assembled piecemeal from published observations such as regional checklists. Therefore, the following listing contains a high proportion of taxa that may still exist, but are listed here due to any combination of absence of recent records, a known threat such as habitat destruction, or an observed decline.
