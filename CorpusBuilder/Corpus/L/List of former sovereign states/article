This page lists sovereign states, countries, nations, empires or territories that have ceased to exist as political entities, grouped geographically and by constitutional nature.


Criteria for inclusion
The criteria for inclusion in this list is similar to that of the List of states with limited recognition. To be included here, a polity must have claimed statehood and either:
* had de facto control over a territory, a population, a government, a capacity to enter into relations with other states, or
* have been recognised as a state by at least one other state.

For purposes of this list, the cutoff between medieval and early modern states is the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.

North America
NameLocationOriginFateNotesIndigenous peoples of the AmericasThe whole of North America (including the Inuit of the Arctic).Native Americans in the United States and the First Nations of Canada had established varying levels of governmental organization before contact with Europeans. The most advanced civilizations of North America were represented by the indigenous peoples in Mexico and Central America. All the native peoples were eventually incorporated into the United States, Mexico, Canada and Central America, but many retain various levels of self-government and autonomy within those nations.CahokiaIllinois, Missouri, Indiana, Kentucky and parts of Ohio.The population of the town at Cahokia exploded circa 1050 AD, indicating the establishment of a large "chiefdom".The population of Cahokia dispersed in the 14th century, indicating the decline of the Cahokia "chiefdom".Other political bodies existed in the Mississippian culture; the Mississippian culture article has a list of Known Mississippian Chiefdoms.Huron ConfederacyCentral Ontario.Confederacy of five Iroquoian tribes and several smaller groups. Controlled trade in corn and furs in the upper Great Lakes area and sporadically through the Ottawa and St. Lawrence River valleys.The Hurons were dispersed by the Iroquois in 1649. Many fled to the northern Lake Michigan region and Quebec, while a large group joined the Iroquois.Iroquois ConfederacyUpstate New York and surrounding areas.Formed before European contact; arguably as early as 31 August 1142, though also likely sometime in the 15th to 17th centuries.The Treaty of Canandaigua, signed in 1794, established relations between the United States government and the Iroquois; the treaty is still in force, though the Confederacy is no longer effectively an independent nation.Cherokee NationOriginally in the southeastern United States, primarily Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, and parts of Alabama and Tennessee. Parts of The Nation (and its government structures) ended up in present-day Oklahoma.The original Cherokee Nation was unified from an interrelated society of city-states in the late 18th century. They enjoyed relatively peaceful relations with the Spanish, British, French, and later (with the exception of the Chickamauga factions), to the USA.The modern Cherokee Nation, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians are the three federally recognized tribal successors to the original Cherokee Nation, being somewhat autonomous within the United States.Vermont RepublicState of Vermont.Organized by Ethan Allen and others in 1777 from territory claimed by New York and New Hampshire.Admitted as a state to the United States of America in 1791. They were originally a part of British North America via the newly conquered province of Quebec.Originally known as Republic of New Connecticut, it had the first written national constitution in North America.State of FranklinNortheastern part of the Washington District, North Carolina (easternmost Tennessee).Seceded from North Carolina 23 August 1784.Government was largely abandoned and the area officially re-incorporated into North Carolina in 1789.Applied for admission to the United States as a separate state.
