Life
Born <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> <font color="blue"><b>Ins</b></font> as the son of veterinarian Samuel Anker (then a member of the constituent assembly of the Canton of <font color="blue"><b>Bern</b></font>), Anker attended school <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> Neuchâtel, where he and Auguste Bachelin, later a fellow artist, took early drawing lessons with Louis Wallinger <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> 1845–48. <font color="blue"><b>In</b></font> 1849–51, he attended the <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> <font color="blue"><b>Bern</b></font>, graduating with the Matura. Afterwards, he studied theology, beginning <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> 1851 <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> <font color="blue"><b>Bern</b></font> and continuing at the university of Halle, Germany. But <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> Germany he was inspired by the great art collections, and <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> 1854 he convinced his father to agree to an artistic career.
<font color="blue"><b>In</b></font> Neuchâtel he got his name Albert, because it was much easier to pronounce for his French speaking classmates. 

Anker moved to Paris, where he studied with Charles Gleyre and attended the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> 1855–60. He installed a studio <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> the attic of his parents' house and participated regularly <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> exhibitions <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> Switzerland and <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> Paris. Anker married Anna Rüfli <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> 1864, and they had six children together; the four children who did not die at an early age – Louise, Marie, Maurice and Cécile – appear <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> some of Anker's paintings. <font color="blue"><b>In</b></font> 1866, he was awarded a gold medal at the Paris Salon for Schlafendes Mädchen im Walde (1865) und Schreibunterricht (1865); <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> 1878 he was made a knight of the Légion d'honneur. <font color="blue"><b>In</b></font> 1870–74 he was a member of the Grand Council of <font color="blue"><b>Bern</b></font>, where he advocated the construction of the Kunstmuseum <font color="blue"><b>Bern</b></font>.

Apart from his regular wintertime stays <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> Paris, Anker frequently travelled to Italy and other European countries. <font color="blue"><b>In</b></font> 1889–93 and 1895–98 he was a member of the Swiss Federal Art Commission and <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> 1900 he received an honorary doctorate from the <font color="red"><b>University of Bern</b></font>. A stroke <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> 1901 reduced his ability to work. Only after his death <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> 1910 was there a first exposition dedicated to him, held at the Musée d'art et d'histoire <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> Neuchâtel.

Works

During his studies, Anker produced a series of works with historical and biblical themes, including paintings of <font color="violetred"><b>Luther</b></font> and <font color="violetred"><b>Calvin</b></font>. Soon after returning to <font color="blue"><b>Ins</b></font>, though, he turned to what would become his signature theme: the everyday life of people <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> rural communities. His paintings depict his fellow citizens <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> an unpretentious and plain manner, without idealising country life, but also without the critical examination of social conditions that can be found <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> the works of contemporaries such as Daumier, <font color="violetred"><b>Courbet</b></font> or Millet. Although Anker did paint occasional scenes with a social significance, such as visits by usurers or charlatans to the village, his affirmative and idealistic Christian world-view did not include an inclination to issue any sort of overt challenge.

Also prominent <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> Anker's work are the more than 30 still lifes he created. They depict both rural and urban table settings <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> the tradition of Chardin, their realist solidity reflecting Anker's vision of a harmonic and stable world order. <font color="blue"><b>In</b></font> addition, Anker created hundreds of commissioned watercolours and drawings, mostly portraits and illustrations, including for an edition of Jeremias Gotthelf's collected works. To provide for a steady income, Anker also decorated more than 500 faience plates for the Alsatian producer Théodore Deck.

Anker was quick to reach his artistic objectives and never strayed from his chosen path. His works, though, exude a sense of conciliation and understanding as well as a calm trust <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> Swiss democracy; they are executed with great skill, providing brilliance to everyday scenes through subtle choices <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> colouring and lighting. Their parochial motives belie the open-mindedness towards contemporary European art and events that Anker's correspondence reflects.

Reception
Albert Anker's work made him Switzerland's most popular genre painter of the 19th century, and his paintings have continued to enjoy a great popularity due to their general accessibility. Indeed, as a student, Anker summed up his approach to art as follows: "One has to shape an ideal <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> one's imagination, and then one has to make that ideal accessible to the people."

Many Swiss postage stamps and other media have incorporated Anker's work. His studio <font color="blue"><b>in</b></font> <font color="blue"><b>Ins</b></font> has been preserved as a museum by the <font color="violetred"><b>Albert Anker</b></font> Foundation. One of Anker's greatest admirers and collectors is former Swiss Federal Councillor <font color="violetred"><b>Christoph Blocher</b></font>, since the 1980s Switzerland's most influential conservative politician, who also published an apologetic essay on Anker.
